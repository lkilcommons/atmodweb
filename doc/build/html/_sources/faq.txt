Who Made AtModWeb?
------------------
 This application was created by, and is maintained by, a single developer at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I made this tool to give community college students interested in space sciences a way to experiment with models of the upper atmosphere. However, it can be used by anyone and I hope that it will. 

 We (the University of Colorado Space Environment Data Analysis Group `CU SEDA <http://ccar.colorado.edu/seda>`_) are writing an academic paper about this application, which we will include here once it's published.
