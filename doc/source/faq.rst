Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Help! I broke the application!
------------------------------

If the application has stopped working properly for you (you made a plot
which caused an error and now the application won't make any plots)
you can click the 'Restart' button in the upper right corner of the user
interface to start your session over again.

The application looks weird in the Safari web brower on my iPhone/iPad/Macbook
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Try using the Firefox web browser. If you are using a phone, try looking at the
site in 'Desktop mode'.

How do I plot multiple variables on a line plot?
------------------------------------------------

When you have selected 'Line Plot' from the 'Type of Plot' pulldown menu,
you can hold the *Shift* key and then click multiple values in the 'X' or 'Y'
selection boxes.

How do I download my graphs?
----------------------------

Right-click on the graph and select 'Save as' to save the plot to you
computer.


Who Made AtModWeb?
------------------
 This application was created by, and is maintained by, a single developer at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I made this tool to give community college students interested in space sciences a way to experiment with models of the upper atmosphere. However, it can be used by anyone and I hope that it will.
