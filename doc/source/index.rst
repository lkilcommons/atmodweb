Welcome to the Documentation for AtModWeb
=========================================

The very creatively named AtModWeb is an Atmospheric Model Web Application. It gives users a way to run data-derived (empirical) models of the neutral atmosphere with strong emphasis on the top-most layer of the atmosphere (the `thermosphere <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermosphere>`_ ). 

The models currently included in AtModWeb:

1. :ref:`msis`

AtModWeb allows you to do two main things with the output of these models:

1. Make Graphs / Plots :ref:`how-to-make-graphs`
2. Download Data :ref:`how-to-download-data`
